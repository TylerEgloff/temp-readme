# Project Summary
This is a summary of the most relevant information related to the eye tracking project. Included are links to documentation, explanations of tools, diagrams of program workflows, and more.

## What is the project?
Our team has various research goals. First and foremost is developing [MediaPipe](###MediaPipe) eye data extraction tools. In short, this means that information about where a subject's eye is looking could be gathered with a simple commerical grade webcam. This would bring with it the potential for various applications such as developing new [brain-vision coordination](##Brain-Vision-Coordination) routines. And other applications could include studying UI/UX design, and studies focused on images such as our [medeival manuscript study](##Medeival-Manuscript-Study).

## Brain-Vision Coordination
The brain-vision coordination avenue of this project seeks to benefit the medical field. Neuro-opthamologists can use eye tracking technology to aid in diagnosis of various neurological, visual, and motor conditions, as well as physical disorders affecting the eye.

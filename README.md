# Projects
#### Vision-Brain Coordination (ongoing)
The goal of this project is to develop [vision-brain coordination](https://github.com/TylerEgloff/temp-readme/blob/main/project-summary.md#Vision-Brain-Coordination) routines for which subjects gaze data is captured by [MediaPipe](https://github.com/TylerEgloff/temp-readme/blob/main/project-summary.md#MediaPipe).

#### Medieval Manuscripts (2024)
The goal of the project was to evaluate how individuals interact with medieval manuscripts having different layouts and visual elements.
